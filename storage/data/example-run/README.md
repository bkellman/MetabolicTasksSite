# Example data 

## HPA

We used the Human Protein Atlas (RNA-seq data of 20344 genes across 32 different human tissues; Ulhen 2015) in combination with Recon2.2 as example of how to use Cellfie to infer metabolic functions from transcriptomic data.

Suggested Run: Local run, 32 samples, minmaxmean: min 25% & max 75%

## aa_metab.csv
